	<p>Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. A common approach is to repeatedly try guesses for the password.</p>

	<p>Users often choose weak passwords. Examples of insecure choices include single words found in dictionaries, given and family names, any too short password 
	(usually thought to be 6 or 7 characters or less), or any password meeting a too restrictive and so predictable, pattern (eg, alternating vowels and consonants).</p>

	<p>A last resort is to try every possible password, known as a brute force attack. In theory, if there is no limit to the number of attempts, a brute force attack will always
	be successful since the rules for acceptable passwords must be publicly known; but as the length of the password increases, so does the number of possible passwords.</p>
