		<p>A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. 
		A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database 
		(such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a 
		type of  injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to effect the execution of predefined SQL commands. </p>
		
		<p>The 'id' variable within this PHP script is vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>
		
		<p>There are 5 users in the database, with id's from 1 to 5. Your mission... to steal passwords!</p>
		
		<p>If you have received a Magicquotes error, turn them off in php.ini.</p>
